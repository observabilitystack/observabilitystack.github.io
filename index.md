# observabilitystack.org

The goal of this project is to leverage a integrated monitoring  & observability 
solution based on free open source software. The observability stack is easy to 
install and a working configuration by default. The stack isintegration tested in Kubernetes (Minikube) and to avoid the Copy&Pasta of YAML files, installation is
based on Helm.
